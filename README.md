# Membership fee challenge

This is a node.js project, using Typescript.

The source code is in `./src`, the test are in `./tests` and the data models are in `models`.

For the unit testing I used Jest.

Download or clone the project and run: `npm install`. After that, you can run `npm run build` to build, and `npm run test` to test.
